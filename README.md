# Just Deep Learning

- Very inefficent, meant for hands on learning
- Tensor class wraps numpy ndarray with karpathy style autograd
- Simple neural network abstractions
- Papers implemented:
    - [ADAM](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1412.6980)
    - [dropout](https://jmlr.org/papers/v15/srivastava14a.html)
